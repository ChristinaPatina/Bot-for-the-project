Hi.  I a looking for a cheap place to stay.  What can you recommend for me?
There is _Choice_ _Type_ and_Choice__Type_ in the _pricerange_ price range. Do you have a preference for type or area?
I would like something in the east of the city, I don't care about internet
How about _Name_? It's _pricerange_ and in the _Area_.
That sounds good, Thank you
Would you like me to book a reservation for you?
Yes. I need a reservation for 2 people for 4 nights starting on Saturday.
I'm sorry, the reservation was unsuccessful. Would you like to try a different day or a shorter stay?
Sure, can you try just 2 nights, please?
Okay, I've made you a reservation at the _name_. Your reference number is _reference_. Can I do anything else for you today?
No that would be all.

Hello, I need to find a hotel with free wifi and free parking. Can you help me?
There are _Choice_ places with free internet and parking. Do you have an area, price, star, or hotel type preference?
Can you find me a guesthouse that is expensive?
Unfortunately, I don't happen to have any _type_s that are in the _pricerange_ range. Can I look in another price range perhaps? 
How about in the moderate price range?
I have _Choice_ _type_s that match your needs. Do you have additional requirements to narrow down the search?
Could you recommend one with free wifi and free parking in the moderate price range, and give me the star rating and phone number?
_Name_ is a _Stars_ star place that meets your requirements. The phone number is _Phone_.
Thank you, that will be all. Goodbye.
Enjoy! Goodbye!

Can you find a guesthouse for me?
Yes there are many. When should I book it for and how many?

How about something with 4 stars and something expensive.
I have _Choice_ options for you - _Name_ _Area_, and_Name__Area_. Are you interested in one of these?
Maybe.  Is either one a 4 star hotel?  If so, I'd like to book a room for 4 nights.
